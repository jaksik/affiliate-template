Being the largest state in the nation, it comes to no surprise that Alaska has 8 national parks that are full of the most jaw dropping landscapes on Earth, these are also the best places to visit in Alaska. What surprises most people is the mind blowing vast amounts of land that these parks cover. The size of Wrangell-St Elias National Park alone, is the size of Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, and Switzerland compbined! 

To visit all of the national parks in Alaska you need to be prepared to put on your hiking boots, fly in a seaplane, and ride on a few boats because half of the national parks in Alaska don't even have roads leading to them because they are so remote.
