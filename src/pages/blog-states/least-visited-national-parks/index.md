After visiting places such as Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Rocky Mountain National Park, at some point you've probably wandered if all of the national parks are this crowded. The answer is no, several of the least visited national parks have less visitors annually than your local Walmart has in a few days.

Several of the least national parks in the united states are so remote that they don't even have roads leading to them, where others are just a few hours outside some of the largest cities in the country, such as San Francisco.

## What are the national parks in California?
The least visited national parks in the United States are vast tundras, large islands, and remote wildernesses. 

Some of these parks can be accessed by a 2 hour drive from San Francisco or Seattle, while others require a substantial amount of planning as well as a boat or plane ride.

**These are the least visited national parks in the United States:**

### 1. Gates of the Arctic

With no roads leading into the park it's no surprise that Gates Of The Arctic National Park is the least visited national park in the United States. On average this park will see less visitors in a year than your local Walmart will see in a few days.

<br/>

At just over a 2 hour drive from downtown Seattle, it's pleasantly shocking to see such a beautiful park have so few visitors.

<br/>

Being the only US National Park located on a continent other than North America, it makes sense that this park doesn't see much traffic.

**Anual Visitors:** 131,802\

Being on the Nevada/Utah border (A.K.A the middle of no where), might be why Great Basin National Park is one of the 10 least visited national parks in the US.

### 11. Virgin Islands
![US Virgin Islands National Park](./virgin-islands.jpg)
**Anual Visitors:** 133,398\

The fact that this national park is on an island is probably why it's one of the least visited.

### 12. Congaree

Perhaps the relatively small amount of traffic this park recieves is the reason why it boasts the largest tract of old growth bottomland hardwood forest in the United States.
