Epic National Parks was founded with the mission of inspiring others to explore and preserve the incredible national parks found throughout the United States. The founders of Epic National Parks are nature enthusiasts who have been visiting the national parks for as long as they can remember. They are hikers, campers, climbers, and of course road trippers.
